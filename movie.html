              <h2>Plot</h2>
              <p>This is the second movie of the Back to the Future trilogy and takes place just after the first movie.
                Marty and the Doc have to use the Delorian Time Machine to travel into the future to stop Marty's son from making a terrible mistake.</p>

              <p> When in the future though, Marty makes an even bigger blunder, building Biff into a extremely wealthy and powerful man in the present.
                This raises the stakes even higher for the main duo, not just having to save Marty's future but the future of the whole world </p>

              <h2>Trivia</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Back to the Future: Part 2 was the third highest grossing film of 1989</li>
                <li>Back to the Future: Part 3 came out just 6 months after part 2 because they were filmed back to back.</li>
                <li>In the film there is a joke about the Cubs winning the 2015 world series, while this didn't actually end up happening they did win the 2016 world series.</li>
                <li>The director of the film said his least favorite part of the movies to shoot were the future scenes
                  <ul><li>He knew trying to predict an accurate future wouldn't be possible which is why he made it so silly, with flying cars and giant shark holograms </li></ul></li>
                <li>The actor that played Marty's father, Crispin Glover, didn't want to return for the second film. The studio instead put prostetics on the new actor, Jeffrey Weissman, to make him look more like the original. He was also hanging upsidedown the whole movie to make him harder to recongnize.
                  <ul><li>He sued the studio for using his likeness without his permission, saying they didn't have the rights to use it. They settled outside of court.</li></ul></li>
